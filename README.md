## Self Assessment
-	I took the role of the project manager to make sure we worked together to make decisions and that we completed everything that was required. 
-	I created the ERD, imported the data in to our SQL database and wrote the query to join the 2 tables together.  
-	I imported the data into Tableau and created the visualizations for our dashboard.  
-	We all contributed to creating the Readme file for each submission.
-	As a team we reviewed each others work and discussed what was completed before we submitted each week.
-	Our biggest challenge was picking our topic and dataset in the first week.  We wasted a lot of planning time trying to decide what we wanted to do.
-	Another challenge was creating our dashboard in Tableau.  We thought that we were very limited with what we could show compared to the visualizations that we created throughout the modules in python. 


## Group Assessment
Our team worked very well together, and I could not have picked a better team myself.

We communicated on Slack in our group chat and had another group with our TA - Priya.  We created a shared google doc, google slides and tableau Account as well as our Github branches where we imported our files.  We all contributed to these as we completed our work as well as the overall analysis for our project.  We scheduled times to meet and everyone always attended and contributed.

Brooke was responsible for setting up and managing Github and made sure that everything was merged correctly.  She also created our presentation slides and was responsible for making sure everything was in the Readme for each deliverable.  She helped in the planning, analysis and decisions for our data processing, Machine learning model and dashboard. Brooke was very organized, communicated well and was a pleasure to work with.

Xikang was responsible for cleaning the data and machine learning model. He showed the most passion for this project and was more technical out of the 3 of us.  He actually taught me a lot during this project and I think his analytical skills were very valuable to our team.  He was also involved in all aspects of the project and contributed to the google slides, dashboard and overall analysis for our project.  He was also a pleasure to work with.

## Project Assessment
We worked with an open-source data set on Kaggle to analyze job changes within data scientist roles. The question we wanted to answer with our analysis was to find out what makes an employee stay based off the data we had.  We cleaned our data source that contained company and employee information and imported into a SQL database to be used for our analysis, machine learning model and dashboard that we built in Tableau. Using the Random Forest model, we were able to get a 84% accuracy score and learned that city development index, number of training hours and past experience weighted the highest.  Our dashboard showed visualizations that showed the category data based off whether an employee stayed or did not stay.
